# 🚀 LeetCode Journey: A Deep Analysis Framework

This repository is a curated collection of LeetCode solutions documented through a rigorous deep-analysis framework. Rather than simply collecting "accepted" solutions, I focus on the underlying **patterns,** **trade-offs,** and **algorithmic efficiency.**

## The Philosophy

Most developers focus on the result. This project focuses on the process. For every problem, I document:

- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying the "why" behind the data structure.
- **Complexity Analysis:** Evaluating Big O time and space.
- **Trade-off Evaluation:** Comparing Brute Force vs. Optimized approaches.
- **Real-World Analogies:** Bridging the gap between abstract code and tangible concepts for my portfolio blog.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by difficulty and problem ID to maintain a scalable knowledge base:

```text
├── Easy/
│   ├── 001-two-sum/
│   │   ├── solution.py      # Primary Solution
│   │   ├── README.md        # Deep Dive Analysis & Blog Draft
│   └── ...
├── Medium/
├── Hard/
└── spreadsheet-index.md     # Master log of all solved problems
```

## 📊 Progress Dashboard

| Problem | Pattern | Time | Space | Blog Post |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **001. Two Sum** | Hash Map | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$ | [Read Post 🔗](#) |
| **020. Valid Parentheses** | Stack | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$ | [Read Post 🔗](#) |
| **121. Best Time to Buy/Sell** | Sliding Window | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ | [Read Post 🔗](#) |

## 🛠️ The "Deep Dive" Template

Every folder in this repo contains a README.md following this structure:

1. **The Core Idea:** A 2-sentence summary of the logic.
2. **The Trade-off:** Why I chose this algorithm over an alternative.
3. **Edge Cases:** What could break this code?
4. **Analogy:** How this relates to a real-world scenario.

## 📈 Roadmap (3-6 Months)

- [x] **Phase 1**: Establish the Documentation Framework (First 10 problems).
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Master the "Blind 75" / "NeetCode 150" lists.
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Translate deep dives into a weekly technical blog series.
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Optimize solutions across multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.).
